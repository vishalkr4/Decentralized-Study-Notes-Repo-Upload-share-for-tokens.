# ðŸ“š Decentralized Study Notes Repository - Upload/Share for Tokens

## 1. Project Title
**Decentralized Study Notes Repository (DSNR)**

## 2. Project Description
This project is a simple smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity, where users can **upload study notes** (represented by a hash) and **earn reward tokens (NOTE)**. The notes are stored immutably with the uploaderâ€™s address, creating a public, verifiable contribution system.

## 3. Project Vision
The aim is to build a **transparent and decentralized knowledge-sharing platform** where contributors are rewarded for educational resources. It removes centralized gatekeeping and promotes open access to learning.

## 4. Future Scope
- Integration with IPFS or Arweave for full decentralized storage.
- Add a rating system for note quality.
- Allow tipping authors in NOTE tokens.
- Add metadata like subject, tags, or difficulty level.
- Gamify with NFT badges for top contributors.
- Build a frontend interface for uploading and viewing notes.
